-Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a financial institution that needs to secure their online presence. They need to implement industry standard best practices in 
encryption and secure connections.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? 
What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

I did well at identifying the high level concepts of security and researching the requirements of the business. It is important to code securely in this 
scenario because Artemis Financial is a high value target for cyber criminals. It is important to protect both the company and its intellectual property 
as well as the clirnt and their sensitive financial information. A high level of security is expected for an institution of this type, any vulnerabilities 
could cause huge amounts of damage. 

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

The vulnerability assessment was helpful in providing a structure to work with regarding the steps necessary to secure the company's software. The assessment 
provides clear steps to achieve a goal.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine 
mitigation techniques?

In future projects security concerns will be front and center, I will develop a strategy for secure code before tackling any other requirements.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new 
vulnerabilities?

Unfortunately my code was never functional. The Maven framework provides excellent feedback on vulnerabilities. That framework, combined with the vulnerability 
assessment, are excellent tools for identifying vulnerable software.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Maven is an excellent tool. As I become more familiar with the processes involved, it will increase the security and efficiency of my code.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular 
assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

If I can refactor this code and improve functionality I would show it to a future employer, as of now I would use my soft skills to make a good impression.
